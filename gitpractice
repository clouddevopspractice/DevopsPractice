# To create repositories in git there are two types of repos
# one is bare repo and another is non bare repos , bare repos are central repos which will be only for storing and sharing data.
# In Non-bare repos we can edit and upload data and also can share data b/w users.

git init --bare   --> This creates central repo
git init -- > Creates only local repo
git clone https://github.com/repository.git workspacename  --> this will clone the workspace from central to local repository.

git add . or git add filename git add foldername ( folders will get add only when it is not empty).

git status (provides status of the workspace), git log (shows the log information with complete commit details) , git log --oneline( displays 7 letters of the commitid)
